- 👋 Hi, I’m @GlassCannonGaming a single Dad trying to teach myself programming.

- 👀 I’m interested in my kids, my animals (sometimes the same thing), horticulture, 
repairing electronics and my years long addiction to Minecraft, in that order.I end up going 
back to it through out the years and always wanted to create my own mods.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and dabbling in Java until I get more comfortable with C#.

- 💞️ At the moment I wouldn't be bringing much to the table as far as collaborating goes.

- 📫 I can be reached through email, connamn360@live.com
